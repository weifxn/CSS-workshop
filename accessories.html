	<p style = "font-style: italic;">This earing is made from Italy. It is mainly designed by diamonds. Hence, the price for it will be a bit expensive but it is quite reasonable as by just paying RM 350, you will be able to obtain the product already :) Click <a href = "https://www.dillards.com/search-term/bridal+accessories/accessories"> here </a> for more designs.</p>
